		<p class="info_big">My hobbies are important part of my life. I can't imagine myself without dancing, being k-pop fan, working out and studying English.</p>

		<span class="info">K-POP. I became a blink (a fan of <b>Bl</b>ackp<b>ink</b>) in April of 2019 after they had released the song "Kill this love". It was an eye-opener for me, because I started dancing.</span></p>

		<span class="info">DANCING. I have gone to dancing twice a week since October 2020. I still have a long way to go, but I definitely see the difference. Success inspires to do more and better!</span></p>
		<p class="hobby_mg"><img src="like.png" class="heart">
		<span class="info">SPORT. It's been two years since I started working out. Initially, I did it to lose some weight, but now it grows into healthy lifestyle, which I will maintain for the rest of my life. My favourite fitness blogger is Pamela Reif.</span></p>
		<p class="hobby_mg"><img src="like.png" class="heart">
		<span class="info">ENGLISH. Foreign languages give opportunities to travel, find out the latest news, communicate with people. I enjoy watching movies on English. My favourite one is "To all the boys I've loved before."</span></p>
